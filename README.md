# Notes

SkelentonView is greyed out for now while I work on implementing it correctly.

Lottie loading animation while Tweets are gathered could also be smoother.

Modally presented timeline screen is now in fullscreen, which is not represented in demostration gifs/video. These gifs will be updated appropriately for part 2.
